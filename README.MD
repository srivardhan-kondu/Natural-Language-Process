# NLP Learning Journey

Welcome to my Natural Language Processing (NLP) learning repository! This is where I document my progress as I explore and learn NLP concepts. I will be updating this repo regularly with new insights, code, and projects.

## Overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence, focused on the interaction between computers and human languages. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
